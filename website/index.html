            <p>The highest peak of the planet, Mount Everest in Nepal is one of the true miracles on earth. Local Tibetan people call it Zhomolungma (meaning 'The Divine Mother of Life'), and the elevation of Everest is estimated to total 29,029 ft (8,848 meters).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="grid-item item-text-2">
            <p>Actually, the mount is located right on the border between Nepal and China, and since the view to Mount Everest from the Nepalese side is blocked by two other high mounts, those who want to observe the highest peak of the world should approach it from the Chinese side.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="grid-item item-text-3">
            <p>Everest is surrounded by many other high peaks located right near it, like Makalu Mount, Changtse Mount, Lhotse Mount, Nuptse Mount, Gyachung kang, Cho Oyu, and a few others, which are all a bit lower than Everest but 4 of them are on the list of the world's highest mountains in the world.</p>
